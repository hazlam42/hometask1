My program takes file name from input. (like Elf.txt Troll.txt Mag.txt e.t.c)

If user inputs wrong file name it will throw exception.

To use my program properly follow the instructions from console.

Thefiles must be in the same folder as the src.

There are already nine files of different characters in that folder.
